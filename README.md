## üßÆ Mathematical Background

### What Makes an ODE Homogeneous?

A first-order ODE is homogeneous if it can be written in the form:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$$

Equivalently, when you replace x with Œªx and y with Œªy, the equation remains unchanged. This scale invariance property is the key to both identifying and solving homogeneous equations.

### The Power of Substitution

Homogeneous ODEs are solved through a clever substitution:

$$u = \frac{y}{x}$$

This transforms the equation into a separable form:

1. Let $u = \frac{y}{x}$, so $y = ux$
2. Differentiate: $\frac{dy}{dx} = u + x\frac{du}{dx}$
3. Substitute into original equation: $u + x\frac{du}{dx} = f(u)$
4. Rearrange: $x\frac{du}{dx} = f(u) - u$
5. Separate variables: $\frac{du}{f(u) - u} = \frac{dx}{x}$
6. Integrate to obtain the general solution

HomoGenius visualizes this entire process, making each step transparent and intuitive.
